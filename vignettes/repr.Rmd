## Overview
### Key concepts
- Accessible versioned data
    - Authentication and validity
- Accessible versioned software
    - Reliability through continuous integration
- Workflows that produce key inferences

### Aims
- Reliability and efficiency in the lab
- Reliability and efficiency of dissemination, uptake, and extension
- Foster refinement of inferences, faithfully implement a vision of open science

## Accessible data
### Local access and management
- Protocol
- Self-description
- Discovery
- Evolution through revision

### Global access and management
- Cloud: democratize access to data
- Discovery problem
- "Move computation to the data"

## Versioned data
### "File" characteristics must be recorded and sufficiently rich
### Audit trail of changes to file contents
### Determine provenance of a file derived from another file
### Propagate durable information about data provenance
### More general data resources (distributed files, streams)
