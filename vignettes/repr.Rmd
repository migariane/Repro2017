## Basic definitions

1) Analysis = software + data + environment 

2) Reproducible analysis = analysis that can be carried out by independent parties

3) Extensible analysis = analysis supporting independent variations

4) Study = Design + implementation + analysis

5) Replicable study = A study that, when executed by independent parties,
produces interpretations that are statistically compatible

## Open questions

1) What is an environment for an analysis?

2) What are independent parties? (See Kahneman's etiquette for replication)

3) What are independent variations on an analysis and why are they important?

4) When are two interpretations of related or identical studies statistically compatible?


## The three themes underlying reproducibility research

1) providing code and data and environment to independent parties
to diminish risk of analyses that are not reproducible

2) fortifying criteria of statistical soundness of analyses (study interpretations) to control risk of non-replicability of studies

3) doing 1) and 2) in ways that are cost-effective


## Overview
### Key concepts
- Accessible versioned data
    - Authentication and validity
- Accessible versioned software
    - Reliability through continuous integration
- Workflows that produce key inferences

### Aims
- Reliability and efficiency in the lab
- Reliability and efficiency of dissemination, uptake, and extension
- Foster refinement of inferences, faithfully implement a vision of open science

## Accessible data
### Local access and management
- Protocol
- Self-description
- Discovery
- Evolution through revision

### Global access and management
- Cloud: democratize access to data
- Discovery problem
- "Move computation to the data"

## Versioned data
### "File" characteristics must be recorded and sufficiently rich
### Audit trail of changes to file contents
### Determine provenance of a file derived from another file
### Propagate durable information about data provenance
### More general data resources (distributed files, streams)
